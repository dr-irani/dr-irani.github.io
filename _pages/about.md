I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My interests are broad, but I am specifically drawn to applications of machine learning and data science that have positive social and humanitarian impact. 

At Johns Hopkins, my coursework and research has been focused in applications of natural language processing and understanding. I am currently working on a project using conceptors to debias word and sentence embeddings. I am also a working with the [JHU-COVID-QA](https://jhu-covid-qa.github.io/) team on developing a conversational agent capable of answering open-ended questions about COVID-19.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, petting cats, playing board games, and exploring the outdoors.
