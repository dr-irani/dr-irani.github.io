I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My interests are broad, but I am specifically drawn to applications of machine learning and data science that have positive social and humanitarian impact. 

At Johns Hopkins, my coursework and research has been focused in applications of natural language processing and understanding. I am currently working as an SDE intern at Amazon. On the side, I am involved with two COVID-related projects, [jhu-covid-optimization](https://covid-resource-allocation.herokuapp.com/) and [JHU-COVID-QA](https://jhu-covid-qa.github.io/).

<h1> Other Interests </h1>
In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, petting cats, playing board games, and exploring the outdoors.
