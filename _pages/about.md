I'm a junior at Johns Hopkins studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. I enjoy problem-solving and promoting equity in the work I do. My research interests include big data, machine learning, and statistics. 

Last summer, I was a student fellow at the University of Washington's Data Science for Social Good program. Working with the Seattle Department of Transportation, I processed data from a several sources and built a scalable and reproducible toolkit to measure accessibility, affordability, and reliability of transportation in Seattle.
